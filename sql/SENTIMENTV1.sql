Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don\'t think I\'m all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13\'6\"), the length (53\') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn\'t gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.',1,'Very Disappointed',1290643200,'11 25, 2010'),(15,'A28B1G1MSJ6OO1','0528881469','A. O Sandness',21,22,'This is a great truck GPS. I\'ve tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND-700.Excellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth/Cat engine. I\'ve used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.I\'m running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn\'t, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.My complaints are relatively minor:Battery life when it is unplugged isn\'t great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn\'t create too much of a problem.The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn\'t tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don\'t expect this kind of slip-up.There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot.

A. Freeman',43,45,'Well, what can I say.  I\'ve had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS \'s, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via\'s or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it\'s very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it\'s really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I\'ve noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I\'ve never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don\'t belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I\'d be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI\'s. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI\'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I\'ll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.',3,'1st impression',1283990400,'09 9, 2010'),(17,'A1H8PY3QHMQQA0','0528881469','Dave M. Shaw \"mack dave\"',9,10,'Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I\'ve driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they\'ll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn\'t make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I\'m sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn\'t make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12\'6\" bridges when I\'m 13\'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin.

After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into \"connected\" mode when it\'s plugged in to a computer.  Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems (\"Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)\").  Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.  I am disappointed that a brand new device does not work with a brand new operating system, though that seems to be the nature of all things now-a-days.

I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13\' 8\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13\'6\" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \"Construction Ahead\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn\'t distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.

When you get it, charge it for a few hours before you use it at all. I\'m not sure if my over sized good laptop even was charging it. So use the wall outlet. It comes with nice cables for both wall outlet and 12 volt, as well as a good usb cable. The supplied mount is excellent and easy to use. No tools required. The screen part snaps into another flat part on the mount and you have to make sure it\'s clicked in all the way or it will drop out.. AFTER IT IS FULLY CHARGED, plug it in the pc and get your first free lifetime update. The software loads fine and tries to start up each time you use the computer. I stopped that and made a shortcut to start it myself. There are no options I saw to disable it from auto starting... I used ccleaner/tools/startup to disable it. The program DOES use a lot of resources when running, but you only need to update once in a while.My first drive with it was Tampa to El Paso. It saves my height, width, weight and hazmat class. I was hauling hazmat. It gave a killer route that would have saved time but I had to alter it for the company fuel stops and routes. It tells you everything you need to know. Where travel centers are and what they have, scales and weigh stations and much more which can all be symbols on the map if you wish. YAY now i don\'t have to buy an iphone. Some stuff in the manual says parts are for future use so I\'m guessing the updates are going to give even more. You can manually adjust the zoom. The automatic screen zooming works great. One time it was dark and cloudy with a cool looking sky and I looked at my screen and saw the exact same thing as I approached a ramp. You can save all your addresses and stops and put notes in them for phone numbers and gate codes etc. Then make groups (folders) for your addresses so you can find them even quicker. I sat there for 9 hours like a jerk and typed in all the company terminals and drop yards. It was fun. I\'m saving each new stop now with notes too.Once the GPS kinda got confused and mixed up my current rout with a completed one. It may have been my fault but I don\'t think so. I just restarted it real quick and it worked fine again.I also used it in my car. It\'s easy to switch between truck and car mode. I drive a medium large car and the 7 inch unit was a bit to big and did obstruct my view a little.The voice is fine and easy to adjust. The thing is nice and it works good. The traffic and road updates for life. I don\'t have to use internet or buy a netbook (with gps) and software... I\'m happy I got it. I don\'t get lost anymore.I like the TND 700. I\'d just like to tell Rand Mcnally that since we spent as much on this as for a laptop, please make this the best and keep updates and innovations coming to us for the next few years at least. I\'m kinda expecting you to make the software on the unit and on the TND DOCK (pc software) a bit better. I\'d also like to be able to set up routes INTERSTATE to INTERSTATE to INTERSTATE to FINAL in order to comply with company route solutions. Sometimes we can\'t take all those better routes the unit suggests. You can make this worthy of five stars with just a little more effort.  Well, I gotta haul A$$.

No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows:1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional $39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed.2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use, not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed, and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market.3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim, it is slow. Worse yet, the route is often wrong. FOr example, this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friend\'s house. Had I followed that route, I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily, I decided to use my paper map. Later, I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location, SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily, I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH.4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it, I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example, if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel, the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost.5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess that\'s why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue.I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my $50 learning mistake, and looking at Microsoft Street & Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005, IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map.I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum.

Bailey \"cbailey139\"',0,0,'I have bought several Blue Loggers along with some other hardware and software, notably GPS PostPro, DeLorme\'s software that will postprocess GPS data to make more accurate positional measurements.The point of postprocessing is to use data acquired over minutes or hours, for example by the Blue Logger, and do calculations after the fact comparing these data to data logged at fixed GPS observing stations around the USA or world. You can measure a point to a few inches, when things go well.If you spend thousands of dollars you can get a nice GPS receiver and software for doing this, like surveyors do. The Blue Logger and PostPro let you do the same thing, though not quite as precisely, for a few hundred dollars. You can\'t use just any GPS receiver - it has to record information separately for every GPS satellite.So, the Blue Logger is the only product out there that can do this unless you spend thousands.On the plus side is the fact that this is even possible. And, the Logger feels like a nice solid little device.On the minus side, though, Blue Loggers just barely work. They\'re probably the most unreliable and difficult electronic product I\'ve ever tried to use. They keep malfunctioning. To make matters worse, I bet other companies that might have tried to put similar products out there would not want to now, because these things are convincing consumers that postprocessing is difficult.I keep using them because I really want the results, but I curse their unreliability every time I do. And this would have been such a perfect product, if they\'d made them work right.I gave them a moderate rating because it\'s great that there is any product out there at all for doing this.

While it might take two people to figure out where to mount it, I mounted this in an RV six feet high by myself.  Just take the bolts off of the bracket with the included wrench, mount it, then put the bracket back on.  I also read that the TV was hard to put on once the mount was on the wall.  There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don\'t travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.  This mount is endlessly adjustable and the tilt and pitch both of the TV can be adjusted.  All in all this is a solid mount with endless adjustments.

I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you\'ll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it\'s a \'universal\' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it\'s nice to have a little \'extra\' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it\'s cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don\'t feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn\'t even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \"off level\" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It\'s not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it\'s an excellent bargain.  I don\'t think I\'ll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.',4,'It works!',1306800000,'05 31, 2011'),(298,'AW90C3YRHB3TG','0972683275','Branden Ramsdell',0,1,'I absolutely would not recommend putting any TV you want to keep intact on this mount.When I pulled the mount out of the box, there was rust already present on the joint for the mounting face.

Possibly shame on me for having a generic made tv and not knowing the exact VESA mounting pattern but I have used the same TV with another universal mount with no issues. Problem was that where my mounting holes in the TV were, I would have almost had to drill a home made hole in the metal to accomodate the tv.

Using the extension arms, the holes on the back of the TV lined up and after tightening the screws, it was very solid as well. Make your connection first, then tighten. The bolt that attaches the TV to the mount arm just before the final step to adjust the position of the screen, seems a little small, but it holds. It took me about 20 minutes to install. For $29, it was a great buy.

This arm comes with all needed mounting hardware for either masonry or wall stud mounting as well as a set of 4 screws for several sizes of panel mounting screws.  It also comes with a small wrench for two different sizes of hex heads on the arm and an allen wrench for one of the arm adjustments.  It is at least a two man operation to attach the flat screen after the arm is attached to the wall.  I mounted mine on a stud in the wall.  For stud mounting you use two of the six mounting hex head lag screws that come with it.  It doesn\'t say exactly in the directions but you should use a 1/4\" drill bit to pre-drill the holes in the stud.  I would not recommend trying to use the included hex wrench to tighten down the wall mounting lag screws, you need more leverage to tighten it than it provides; use a crescent wrench or other longer hex wrench.  I used a stud finder to locate the studs accurately.  Make sure you do not have obvious pipes or electrical going through the wall at the chosen location.  They can throw off some stud finders.  If you want to quickly adjust one of the arm adjustment screws it also contains a replacement screw that has a slip bar top lever so that it can be loosened and tightened without a wrench.  There is one optional cable management loop that attaches to the bottom of the middle of the arm.  It could use one more at the wall, but that is easy to improvise.

BTW, the pre- mounted bolts, as shipped, are torqued on tightly, watch the fingers and hands so as not to mash them once the torque pressure is released as you untighten them.  I strongly suggest using your own tools. Either a racket wrench or correct size box wrench. The lag bolts provided for mounting are large and should be mounted in a wall stud 2x4. To prevent splitting the stud, drill progressively larger pilot holes until you acheive the size correct for the mounting the lag bolts. The instructions are minimal and vague.

Thankfully when installed it was at an appropriate level for my use and is not a big issue. Another very slight issue is that the arm has the slightest wiggle to it, so that, when the arm is fully extended the monitor is slightly off level.

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don\'t know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud.

The unit is already assembled right out of the box and just needs to be attached to the TV and a wall stud.  I made a quick template by rubbing a blank piece of paper on top of the wall bracket with a pencil. I then used a stud finder to locate the nearest studs where I wanted the TV to be and taped the template to the wall.  I used a drill driver to make pilot holes for the lag screws which helps greatly with getting them in.  I was able to use four of the lag screws.  There is a plastic two piece lag screw cover (included) that clicks together easily over the lag screw heads to make for a clean look.  The wall bracket allows for different screw patterns for easier installation.  Once I had the mount secured to the wall, it was time to attach the TV to its bracket.  This took two of us to do it quickly.  One lifted the TV and the other pressed the bracket flush against the TV and hand tightened the four screws that go into the back of it. This allowed the TV to be supported easier while a screwdriver was used to finish tightening the four screws.  After that, it was just a matter of adjusting the angle of the mount for the best TV viewing.This thing works as advertised.  The extension arm works smoothly and without much effort.  The tilt function has a nut that loosens to allow for pivot adjustments.  The cord management system works well to bundle the various cables and makes for a clean look.

Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won\'t get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it\'s my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that\'s done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it\'s mounted, it\'s a more secure connection, but it\'s the mounting that\'s the problem.  You can\'t do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).

'),(72,14,'Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  '),(73,14,'After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.

'),(84,15,'Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. '),(85,15,'The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. '),(86,15,'I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. '),(87,15,'Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them.

'),(90,15,'Even if it didn\'t, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.My complaints are relatively minor:Battery life when it is unplugged isn\'t great. '),(91,15,'However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn\'t create too much of a problem.The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn\'t tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. '),(92,15,'Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. '),(93,15,'For $500 smackers, I don\'t expect this kind of slip-up.There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it.

'),(96,15,'Annoying.Clean up the minor issues and this unit rates a solid 5.Rand McNally 528881469 7-inch Intelliroute TND 700 Truck GPS'),(97,16,'Well, what can I say.  '),(98,16,'I\'ve had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  '),(99,16,'Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  '),(100,16,'One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  '),(101,16,'What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS \'s, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  '),(102,16,'I could add up to 10 Via\'s or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  '),(103,16,'Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  '),(104,16,'However it was not truck specific.  '),(105,16,'And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  '),(106,16,'After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  '),(107,16,'Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  '),(108,16,'The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  '),(109,16,'It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  '),(110,16,'The first thing I noticed was it\'s very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  '),(111,16,'Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it\'s really not that big of a deal.  '),(112,16,'The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  '),(113,16,'That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  '),(114,16,'There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  '),(115,16,'The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  '),(116,16,'As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  '),(117,16,'That was a big no go with this unit.  '),(118,16,'While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  '),(119,16,'Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  '),(120,16,'Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  '),(121,16,'Unbelievable.  '),(122,16,'Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  '),(123,16,'For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  '),(124,16,'I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  '),(125,16,'I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I\'ve noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  '),(126,16,'I\'ve never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  '),(127,16,'In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  '),(128,16,'What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don\'t belong on.  '),(129,16,'Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  '),(130,16,'What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  '),(131,16,'County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  '),(132,16,'Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  '),(133,16,'However I\'d be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI\'s. '),(134,16,'Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  '),(135,16,'I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  '),(136,16,'It would also be nice if I could add my own POI\'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  '),(137,16,'If not I will go back to Garmin.  '),(138,16,'I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I\'ll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.'),(139,17,'Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. '),(140,17,'I\'ve driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. '),(141,17,'Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they\'ll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. '),(142,17,'I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. '),(143,17,'Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. '),(144,17,'But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. '),(145,17,'I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. '),(146,17,'Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. '),(147,17,'Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn\'t make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. '),(148,17,'Here I\'m sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn\'t make me happy. '),(149,17,'This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. '),(150,17,'Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. '),(151,17,'At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. '),(152,17,'Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. '),(153,17,'You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. '),(154,17,'Twice it put me under 12\'6\" bridges when I\'m 13\'6\". '),(155,17,'Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. '),(156,17,'I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. '),(157,17,'All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. '),(158,17,'It just had to many route mistakes. '),(159,17,'Going back to the basic garmin. '),(160,17,'This isn\'t just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. '),(161,17,'All of us returned the units.'),(162,18,'My brother is a trucker and pre-ordered this.  '),(163,18,'He was out on the road when it arrived, so he asked me to charge it, update it, and play with it.  '),(164,18,'FUN!  '),(165,18,'I am not a trucker, but from what I hear from my brother, the tools on this device are awesome.  '),(166,18,'It looks like it would be very helpful for him.  '),(167,18,'The thing is huge, a 7\" screen!  '),(168,18,'Overall, this seems to be a great tool.My problem with it is that it cannot update.  '),(169,18,'I have a brand new computer running Windows 7 64 bit.  '),(170,18,'It\'s a Dell Studio XPS 8100 (i5 processor).  '),(171,18,'After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into \"connected\" mode when it\'s plugged in to a computer.  '),(172,18,'Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems (\"Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)\").  '),(173,18,'Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.  '),(174,18,'I am disappointed that a brand new device does not work with a brand new operating system, though that seems to be the nature of all things now-a-days.  '),(175,18,'I am hoping that it will update on my brother\'s XP laptop. we\'ll see when he gets back home.'),(176,19,'This unit is a fantastic aide for truckers. '),(177,19,'Many great features that make it useful. '),(178,19,'Accuracy does not always seem to be current. '),(179,19,'At times it takes you many miles out of the way to get to where you are going. '),(180,19,'Also the graphics are very jerky. '),(181,19,'They could be a lot smoother. '),(182,19,'Very informative, but could be a lot smoother. '),(183,19,'Also, it does not zoom in like it should when exiting or turning.'),(184,20,'I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7\" GPS.  '),(185,20,'Has better graphics than Cobra 7\".  '),(186,20,'It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  '),(187,20,'I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  '),(188,20,'Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  '),(189,20,'I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13\' 8\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13\'6\" bridges.  '),(190,20,'The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  '),(191,20,'Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  '),(192,20,'Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  '),(193,20,'This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  '),(194,20,'Many times I have gone into areas that it said \"Construction Ahead\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  '),(195,20,'But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  '),(196,20,'It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  '),(197,20,'It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. '),(198,20,'You reset every day manually.  '),(199,20,'Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. '),(200,20,'You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn\'t distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  '),(201,20,'I just manually configure at the end of the day.  '),(202,20,'The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  '),(203,20,'You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  '),(204,20,'saves info for 1 year.  '),(205,20,'Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  '),(206,20,'A definite must buy.'),(207,21,'I purchased this product not to use in commerical trucking but rather to use when I am traveling with my 5th wheel RV.  '),(208,21,'So far this product as been very good.  '),(209,21,'Rand McNally folks seem to be working to continue to improve the software along with prompt updates.  '),(210,21,'Although designed for the trucking industry it works great for us RV folks as well.  '),(211,21,'I found for a 2500 HD pickup the unit is a little large for the windshield.
