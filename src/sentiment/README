breakReviewIntoSentence

step 2
now tagging the sentences using stanFord post tagger
TagText

step 3
generating set of nouns for doing association mining

opinionExtraction

step 6: 
generating seedlist of adjectives which we can assign polarity
in our seedlist we took 30 adjectives for which we are sure, this 30 are top 30 frequency wise in our data
generatingSeedlistAdjective

step : 7

sentenceOrientation

step : 9
generating score of each sentences
sentenceScore
